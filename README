Rust regular temperament library
================================

This is a re-implementation of some of my Python temperament finding
code in Rust.


Native-code application
-----------------------

The standard target finds regular temperaments and shows the results
in a machine-readable format that is JSON-consistent, and works
with the latest Python library: https://bitbucket.org/x31eq/regular
Supply the number of results for each rank, the cangwu parameter
(cents/octave), and the prime limit.

7-limit:

cargo run 5 1 7


2.3.7-limit:

cargo run 5 1 2 3 7


11-limit as inharmonic timbre:

cargo run 5 1 cents <<FIN
1200.0
1901.9550008653875
2786.3137138648344
3368.825906469125
4151.317942364757
FIN


For other build targets, this project includes a makefile, because
I like makefiles.  To do a faster calculation for a big limit
(currently incomplete results):

make release && target/release/regular 5 0.1 257


WebAssembly (Wasm) application
------------------------------

You can also run the code in a web browser without Python
or other server-side support.  You need a matching version of
wasm-bindgen-cli:

cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.108

It's important that the version matches the one the build uses
or you get a perplexing error.  Check

cargo info wasm-bindgen

or whatever the tools tell you to do.

Once you have it,

make wasm

and run a web server from the project root.  For example,

python3 -m http.server


If you have wasm-opt, you can also try

make wasm-release

This should make the code smaller, and maybe faster, and put it in
the root folder.  If you don't have wasm-opt, you can get it from

https://github.com/webassembly/binaryen


To get documentation including the Wasm code:

make doc
